## Learning Objectives


Students will be able to:

1. Identify the data **entities** for an application

1. Identify **attributes** for a data entity

1. Identify the **relationships** between data entities

1. Understand the roles of **primary** and **foreign keys**

1. Create an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for an application


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Data Modeling


An important part of the planning process for an application is determining the data persistence needs of that application.

This planning results in a **data model**.

The **data model** is conceptual and is used as a blueprint for implementing the data persistence needs within a given database technology (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).

The data model is typically visualized with an **Entity Relationship Diagram** (ERD).

<br>
<br>
<br>



### What is a Data Entity?


A **Data Entity**, or just **entity**, is used to conceptually model (represent) a real-world object within an application.

Examples:  **User**, **Post**, **Comment**, **Order**, **Product**, etc.

Each entity type will have one or more **attributes**...


<br>
<br>
<br>


### The Attributes for a Data Entity


**Attributes** represent an entity's data. For example, a **Book** entity would probably have a **title** attribute.

Each attribute has a data type. For example, _string_, _numeric_, _datetime_


<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise (2 minutes)


**Identify what other attributes a Book entity might have?** 

<br>
<br>
<br>


### Mapping Between an Entity and a Relational Database

1. Remember, the **conceptual data model** is used as a **blueprint** for how the actual database will be structured.

1. Each **entity** in the data model identifies a **table** in the database. For example, a **Book** entity will result in a **books** table in the database.

1. Each **attribute** in an entity identifies a **column** in the table.  For example, the **title** attribute will result in a column with the same name.

1. Each **row** in the table is logically an **instance** of the **entity**.

<br>
<br>
<br>




## Designing an Entity Relationship Diagram

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



### The Application


Let's design an ERD for a Concert Ticket tracking application.

The application should track:

1. The tickets for a concert
1. The seat and price of the ticket
1. The date of the concert
1. The performer of the concert
1. The venue of the concert
1. The customer that bought a ticket


<br>
<br>
<br>




### The Process


Reviewing an application's **user stories** is a good first step to creating the conceptual data model.

There are three components that must be identified:

1. The **data entities** (tables)

2. The **attributes** (columns) for each entity

3. The **relationships** between the entities.

Since this application is supposed to track **tickets**, let's start with a preliminary **Ticket** entity...


<br>
<br>
<br>



### Identifying Data Entities


Here's our first attempt at modeling the **Ticket** entity by including all the attributes you might see printed on a ticket:

<br>
<br>
<br>




### Identifying Data Entities


Now let's identify which attributes the **Ticket** entity currently has that should be their own entity.

To do this, we can look for current attributes that:

1. Could have attributes of their own, e.g., a **Venue**. 

1. Or, be shared between other Tickets, again, a **Venue**.



<br>
<br>
<br>


### Identifying Data Entities


To help with the following exercise, this is how the data might look like in the **tickets** table:

On to the exercise...


<br>
<br>
<br>


### Identifying Data Entities - Exercise

#### Pair up and analyze the preliminary Ticket entity.

#### The goal is to identify separate Data Entities and their attributes.

#### We will review your findings in 5 minutes.

#### Don't cheat by looking ahead ðŸ˜Š

### Data Entities Galore!

<br>

### Database Normalization (Vocab)



[Database Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) is a database design technique.


A **relational** database is able to perform searching & updating of data much more efficiently when it is "normalized".


Okay, with the entities and their attributes set, let's talk about the third component of the ERD - **relationships** between the entities...

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



### Relationships Between Entities


**Relationships** determine how the entities are related in terms of their **cardinality**.

There are three main types of **cardinality**:
	- **one-to-one** (1:1)
	- **one-to-many** (1:M)
	- **many-to-many** (M:M)

Let's take a look at each of these...



<br>
<br>
<br>



### One-To-One Relationships


The **one-to-one** relationship exists when one row in a table is "linked" to one row in another table.

Although **1:1** relationships are not as common as **1:M** and **M:M** relationships, they have their purpose.

Let's see how we specify a one-to-one relationship in an ERD...



<br>
<br>
<br>



### One-To-One Example


A **business** has one **mailing address** and vice-versa:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fTCHHpF.png" height="300">

Let's discuss the connecting line and PK/FK stuff...


<br>
<br>
<br>




### ERD Cardinality Lines


In an ERD, lines drawn between entities describe the cardinality between those entities as follows:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sEnNZyZ.png">

Note that these are the three main types of cardinality. There are more specific versions of these, such as _zero or many_, as [shown here](https://imgur.com/JtPQEOO).



<br>
<br>
<br>



### Primary Keys



But what are those **(PK)** and **(FK)** attribute annotations you ask?


An attribute (column) annotated with **PK** designates the **Primary Key** for that entity (table).


It is what uniquely identifies a row in a table.


Although not as common, a **PK** can be a _composite key_, where two or more columns are combined and uniquely identify the a row.


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Foreign Keys



An attribute (column) annotated with **FK** designates a **Foreign Key**.


A **FK** provides the "link" to a **PK** in another table.


Foreign Keys are what enable a database engine to efficiently join two tables that are related.


It's **important** to note that foreign keys always exist on the **many** (child) side of a **1:M** relationship.  **Why would this be the case instead of the other way around?**


<br>
<br>
<br>



### Determining the Cardinality Between Tables

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4iq2IOu.png" height="450">


Okay, back to modeling the relationships between the entities of the _ticket tracking_ application...
	

As a note, to save screen space, the entities are not going to show attributes for the primary and foreign keys.


However, be aware that as a default, primary keys are named `id` and foreign keys as `<parent_entity_name>_id`.


Usually by focusing on two entities, [domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge) and common-sense will reveal the relationship (usually aone-to-many or many-to-many)


Beginning with **Concert** and **Ticket** **...what's the relationship?**


Let's see how this is diagramed...


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Creating the ERD

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jlKmola.png" height="400">


Reads as: **"A Concert has many Tickets"** and **"A Ticket belongs to a Concert"**.


**Which of the two tables would have to contain the FK?**


Now for **Customer** and **Ticket** **...what's the relationship?**


<br>
<br>



<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Uc4wHF.png" height="400">

Reads as: **"A Customer has many Tickets"** and **"A Ticket belongs to a Customer"**.

<br>
<br>
<br>




#### Is there a relationship between the **Customer** and **Concert** entities? ...


<br>
<br>
<br>


### Creating the ERD - (cont)



Thanks to the way relational databases are designed, you can access other tables that are not directly joined by joining with others that are.


For example, you most certainly could access all of the _concerts_ purchased by a _customer_ by joining through _tickets_.


Although not shown on the ERD with a connecting line, you could say that **"A Customer has many Concerts through Tickets"**, as well as, **"A Concert has many Customers through Tickets"**.


<br>
<br>
<br>



### Creating the ERD - Exercise <small>(5 min)</small>


As a pair exercise, please identify the remaining relationships:
1. **Concert** and **Venue**
1. **Concert** and **Performer**

We'll review in 5 minutes... (don't peek)


<br>
<br>
<br>



### ERD - Final Version

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qz8V0NX.png" height="400">

Note that **many-to-many** relationships, e.g., **Concert** and **Performer**, require a "hidden" join table to implement in the  database - **Why is this**?



<br>
<br>
<br>



## In Summary


1. Modeling data is an important step during the planning of an application.  After all, _**data is the single source of truth**_!

1. In addition to what we covered in this lesson, there are several other notations/ways to diagram an application's data model.  Check out [this post](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams) from _lucidchart.com's_ website for more info.
