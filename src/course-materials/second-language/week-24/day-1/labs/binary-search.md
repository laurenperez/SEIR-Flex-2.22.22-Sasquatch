### Binary Search

[Exercise Repo Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/shawkitajima/computer-science/tree/main/binary-searches)

```JS 
function binarySearch(arr, element){
    //  search through the array non-recursively for the element
    //  if the element is not found, return -1
    //  if the element is found, return the index at which it was found
}

function recursiveBinarySearch(arr, element){
    //  search through the array recursively for the element
    //  you may need to add more parameters to this function!
    //  if the element is not found, return -1
    //  if the element is found, return the index at which it was found
}

module.exports = {
    binarySearch,
    recursiveBinarySearch
}
```
