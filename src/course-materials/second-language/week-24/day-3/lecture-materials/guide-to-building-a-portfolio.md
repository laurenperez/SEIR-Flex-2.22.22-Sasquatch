# A Guide to Building Your Portfolio Site

<br>
<br>

A Portfolio Website is essential to all Developers as it allows us to show off our work. 

Here are some important considerations:

- We suggest creating your site with HTML, CSS, and Javascript **OR** Wordpress (see below)
- No site builder services are permitted. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Bourbon, etc. are okay, but site builders like Hugo, Wix, Weebly, Squarespace etc. are **not** okay. If you aren't sure about it, ask an instructor.

## Here are some other attributes of a great porfolio site:

Your site ...

- Is deployed to vercel, netlify, heroku, or github pages or hosted somewhere else
- Contains a list of your current projects (with links to the live sites)
- Contains your resume
- Contains your bio
- Contains a link to your github profile
- Contains a link to your LinkedIn account
- Must be functional for all screen sizes (responsive)

**Optional: Your Site is Built Using WordPress**
- It is estsimated that 31% of webpages are built with WordPress. If you think you'd like to work in Wordpress then it is strongly encouraged that you have your porfolio built in Wordpress. [More info on wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
