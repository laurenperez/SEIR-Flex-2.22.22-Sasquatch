<br>

## Learning Objectives

<br>

<p>Students will be able to:</p>

- Use _lists_, _tuples_ & _dictionaries_ as containers for data

- Use _list comprehensions_ to create lists

- Create subsets of a _sequence_ using the _slice_ operator


<br>
<br>
<br>



## Setup
<br>

To test some of the examples and complete the exercises, please open a Python [_repl.it_](https://repl.it/)

<br>
<br>
<br>




### General Purpose Containers
<br>

As you know by now, applications frequently need to maintain collections of data within a _container_ data type.

**What did we use in JS to hold collections of data?**

In this lesson, we're going to review the following Python built-in types commonly used as _containers_:
	- **dictionaries**
	- **lists**
	- **tuples**


<br>
<br>
<br>




## Dictionaries

<br>
<br>





### Dictionaries - Purpose
<br>

- **Dictionaries** are to Python as **objects** are to JS.

- A **dictionary** provides a container for `key: value` pairs. We can refer to `key: value` pairs as **items**.

- _Dictionaries_ have a class (type) of `dict`.



<br>
<br>
<br>



### Dictionaries - Basic Syntax
<br>

Like _objects_ in JS, a **dictionary** is created with a set of _curly braces_:

```python
student = {
	'name': 'Fred',
	'course': 'SEIR',
	'current_week': 7
} 
```
Unlike in JS, _strings_ used as keys must be quoted.

If not quoted, Python expects the identifier to be a variable holding what you want to use as the key. This is similar to how _computed properties_ work in JS.

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Dictionaries - Features
<br>

<p><em>Dictionaries</em></p> have the following features:

- They are unordered (just like JS objects)

- They are mutable:
 	- The values assigned to a key can be changed
 	- Additional items can be added
 	- Existing items can be deleted
 
- Any immutable type can be used as a key, including _numbers_ and _tuples_ (which we'll cover in a bit).


<br>
<br>
<br>


### Dictionaries - Getting/Setting Values
<br>

We use _square brackets_ to get and set an item's value:

```python
name = student['name']
print(name)
> Fred
student['name'] = 'Tina'
print(name)
> Tina
```

Unlike JS, you cannot access items in a Python dictionary using **dot notation** (dots are used to invoke methods).


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Dictionaries - <span style="text-transform: lowercase">get</span> Method
<br>

Unlike JS which returns `undefined` when accessing a property that does not exist, a _dictionary_ will raise a `KeyError`.

One option to avoid this error is to use the `get` method:

```python
birthdate = student['birthdate']
> KeyError: 'birthdate'
print( student.get('birthdate') )
> None
# Provide a default value if key not in dictionary
print( student.get('birthdate', '07-04-1776') )
> 07-04-1776
```


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Dictionaries - <span style="text-transform: lowercase">in</span> Operator
<br>

Another way to avoid the `KeyError` is to use the `in` operator to check if the _dictionary_ includes a key:

```python	
if 'course' in student:
    print( f"{student['name']} is enrolled in {student['course']}")
else:
	print( f"{student['name']} is not enrolled in a course")
```

<br>
<br>
<br>




### Dictionaries - Adding Items
<br>

Simply assigning to a _key_ that does not exist will create a new item in the dictionary:

```python
student['age'] = 21
```


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Dictionaries - Deleting Items
<br>

The `del` statement is used to delete an item from a _dictionary_:

```python
del student['age']
# Verify that item was deleted
'age' in student
> False
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Dictionaries - Number of Items
<br>

Use the built-in `len` function to retrieve the number of items in a _dictionary_:

```python
print( student )
> {'name': 'Tina', 'course': 'SEI'}
len(student)
> 2
len({})
> 0
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Dictionaries - Iterating Items
<br>

`for` loops are used to iterate over the items in a dictionary. However, the following is considered to be a Python [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):

```python
for key in student:
	print( f"{key} = {student[key]}" )
```
	
The preferred way is to use the `items()` method to obtain a [dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects)...

<br>

The best practice way to iterate over the items in a _dictionary_ is to use a `for` loop to iterate over a _dictionary view object_ as follows:

```python
for key, val in student.items():
	print( f"{key} = {val}" )
```
<br>

The `student.items()` call above returns a wrapped set of _tuples_:

```python
student.items():
> dict_items([('name', 'Tina'), ('course', 'SEI')])
```

The `for` statement "unpacks" the tuples by assigning its values to multiple variables like with `key, val` above.

<br>
<br>
<br>



## üí™ <small>Dictionary Practice Exercise - (10 minutes)</small>
<br>

1. Define a Python _dictionary_ named **`where_my_things_are`** containing a few items; where  the `keys` are things you have, and the `value` is the location you keep those things.

2. Write a `for` loop that iterates over the items in the dictionary and prints each one as _My [thing] is kept [location]_.


<br>
<br>
<br>



## Lists

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Purpose
<br>

- **Lists** are to Python as **arrays** are to JS.

- A **list** provides a container for zero or more items (_elements_).

- **Lists** can contain items of different types, including _dictionaries_ and nested _lists_.

- **Lists** have a class (type) of `list`.


<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Basic Syntax
<br>

Like _arrays_ in JS, a **list** is created with a set of _square brackets_:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'] 
```

The number of items in a _list_ is returned using the built-in `len()` function:

```python
len(colors)
> 3
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Features
<br>

<p><em>Lists</em></p> have the following features:

- They are considered to be a _sequence_ type in Python. A _sequence_ is a generic term used for an **ordered** collection. 
- Other _sequence_ types in Python include _strings_ and _tuples_.

- Lists are mutable:

- Items within the _list_ can be replaced
- Items can be added and removed from a _list_

<br>
<br>
<br>




### Lists - Accessing Items
<br>

Accessing the individual items of a _list_ is much like accessing elements in a JS array, i.e., by using _square brackets_ with an expression that evaluates to an integer:

```python
idx = 1
colors[idx + 1]
> blue
```

However, unlike in JS, we can use negative integers to index from the end of a _list_:

```python
colors[-1]
> blue
```


No need to write code like `colors[len(colors) - 1]` - yay!


<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Assigning Items
<br>

We also use square brackets to target an item of a _list_ for assignment:

```python
colors[-1] = 'brown'
print(colors)
> ['red', 'green', 'brown']
```


<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Adding Items
<br>

The equivalent to JS's `push()` method is `append()`:

```python
colors.append('purple')
```
	
	
However, unlike JS's `push()` method, `append()` can only add one item and does not return a value.
	
<br>
<br>
<br>

For adding multiple items, use the `extend()`:

```python
colors.extend(['orange', 'black'])
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Inserting Item
<br>

To add items to anywhere but the end of a _list_, use the `insert()` method:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
colors.insert(1, 'yellow')
> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Deleting Items
<br>


Yup, there's a `pop()` method, but it's more flexible in Python because you can specify the index of the item to remove and return:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
green = colors.pop(2)
print(colors)
> ['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
```
<br>
<br>


If you don't care about the value returned by `pop()`, you can also use the `del` operator to delete items:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
del colors[1]
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
```

<br>
<br>

Also there's a `remove()` method that removes the first item that matches what you pass in:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
colors.remove('orange')
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'black']
```

No value is returned by the `remove()` method.


<br>
<br>
<br>




### Lists - Clearing
<br>


Lastly, `clear()` does just what it's name implies:

```python
print(colors)
> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'black']
colors.clear()
print(colors)
> []
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Lists - Iteration
<br>

The `for` loop is used to iterate over the items in a _list_:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
	print(color)
> red
> green
> blue
```

<br>
<br>

If we need to access the index of the item while iterating a _list_, we use the built-in `enumerate()` function to provide the index and the value to a `for` loop:

```python
for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
	print(idx, color)
> 0 red
> 1 green
> 2 blue
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## List Comprehensions


- One of the most powerful features in Python are _list comprehensions_.

- _List comprehensions_ provide a concise way to create and work with lists.

- They will probably seem a little confusing as first, but they certainly are a favorite of _Pythonistas_ and you will certainly come across them when googling.

<br>
<br>
<br>


### List Comprehensions<br><small>Numerical Example</small>
<br>

If we needed to square all of the numbers in a _list_ and put them into a new _list_, we might use a for loop like this:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
squares = []
for n in nums:
	squares.append(n * n)
print(squares)
> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


**What method in JS would we use in this scenario?**


A _list comprehension_ can reduce this code:

```python
# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
squares = []
for n in nums:
	squares.append(n * n)
```
<br>
<br>

To this:

```python
# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
squares = [n * n for n in nums]
```
<br>
<br>


The _comprehension_ is basically an advanced `for` loop within _square brackets_ which, of course, returns a new _list_.

<br>
<br>
<br>



### List Comprehensions - Basic Syntax
<br>

Here's the basic syntax of a _list comprehension_:

```python
# [<expression> for <item> in <list>]
# This reads as: I want <expression> for each <item> in <list>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


### List Comprehensions - Filtering

We've seen how _list comprehensions_ are a nice way to map a list, but they can be used for **filtering** too.

Again, we'll start by using a `for` loop to map and filter simultaneously:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even
even_squares = []
for n in nums:
	square = n * n 
	if square % 2 == 0:
		even_squares.append(square)
print(even_squares)
> [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

<br>
<br>


Again _list comprehensions_ reduce the mapping and filtering from:

```python
# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even
even_squares = []
for n in nums:
	square = n * n 
	if square % 2 == 0:
		even_squares.append(square)
```
To this one-liner:

```python
# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even
even_squares = [n * n for n in nums if (n * n) % 2 == 0]
```
Nice and readable!

### List Comprehensions - Summary
<br>

Keep in mind that we've only scratched the surface of _list comprehensions_.

## Tuples

<br>
<br>
<br>




### Tuples - Purpose
<br>

- **Tuples** in Python are very similar to **lists**.

- _Tuples_ have a class (type) of `tuple`.

<br>
<br>
<br>



### Tuples - Basic Syntax
<br>

_Tuples_ can be defined in a few different ways.  Most basically, they are defined like this:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print(colors)
> ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print( len(colors) )
> 3
``` 
Although it seems that _parentheses_ are used to create _tuples_, it's actually the _commas_...

<br>
<br>



For more proof that the use of commas create a tuple, let's say you wanted to create a 1-tuple containing the string of "Hello".

If parens created tuples, this would work:

```python
hello_tuple = ('Hello')
```
<br>
<br>


But it doesn't, however, this will:

```python
hello_tuple = ('Hello',)
# or the following
hello_tuple = 'Hello',
```

<br>
<br>

_Tuples_ can be created without using any parentheses:

```python
colors = 'red', 'green', 'blue'
print(type(colors))
> <class 'tuple'>
```
<br>
<br>

However, creating single-item _tuples_ without parens requires a trailing comma:

```python
colors = 'purple',  # tuple, not a string
print(type(colors), len(colors))
> <class 'tuple'> 1
print(colors)
> ('purple',)
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Differences Between Tuples & Lists

- _Tuples_ are immutable, so they are great for protecting data that you don't want changed.

- Python iterates over _tuples_ faster than _lists_. _Tuples_ can also be used as _keys_ for _dictionaries_.

- Generally, you'll find that _tuples_ are used to contain heterogeneous (different) data types and _lists_ for homogeneous (similar) data types.

- _Tuples_ are often classified based on how many items they contain, e.g., a **2-tuple** would be used to hold a `key` and its `value`

<br>
<br>
<br>


### Tuples - Accessing Items

Although _tuples_ can't be modified like _lists_, we can retrieve their items in exactly the same way:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
green = colors[1]
print(green)
> green
```
_Sequences_ also have an `index()` method that returns the index of the first match:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
blue_idx = colors.index('blue')
print(blue_idx)
> 2
```

<br>	
<br>
<br>



### Tuples - Iteration
<br>

Just like with _lists_, other _sequences_ are iterated upon in the same way - by using `for` loops:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
	print(idx, color)
> 0 red
> 1 green
> 2 blue
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


### Tuples - Unpacking
<br>

_Tuples_ have a convenient feature, called _unpacking_, for doing multiple variable assignment:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
red, green, blue = colors
print(red, green, blue)
> red green blue
```

A tuple of variables on the left-side of the assignment operator and a tuple of values on the right is all it takes.

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Sequences Can Be "Sliced"

<br>
<br>

### Slicing Sequences
<br>

Python is known for having some cool tricks up its sleeve, for one, there's the "slice" operator (`[m:n]`).

Since _sequence_ types are a collection of items (BTW, characters are the items in a _string_), we can target subsets, called _slices_, of those items using `[m:n]`.

<br>
<br>

Just like with indexing, slicing uses _square brackets_, but adds a _colon_:

```python
short_name = 'Alexandria'[0:4]
print(short_name)
> Alex
```

Note that the slice includes up to, but not including the index to the right of the colon.


<br>
<br>
<br>

If the first index is omitted, the slice copies the _sequence_ starting at the beginning:

```python
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
print( colors[:2] )
> ('red', 'green')
```
 
If the up to index is omitted, the slice copies the _sequence_ all the way to the end:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
print( colors[1:] )
> ['green', 'blue']
```

<br>
<br>

### Slicing Sequences - Question
<br>

**What would the value of `fruit_copy` be?**

```python
fruit = ('apples', 'bananas', 'oranges')
fruit_copy = fruit[:]
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Conclusion
<br>

Python offers amazing power, convenience and readability with features such as _list comprehensions_ and _slicing_.

However, as usual, it takes practice to become "comfortable" with these concepts, so on to the lab...
