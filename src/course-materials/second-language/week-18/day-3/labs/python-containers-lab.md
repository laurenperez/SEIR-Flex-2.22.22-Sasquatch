# Python Containers - Lab

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Setup

Use a Python-based [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls) to complete the following exercises...

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Exercises

<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise 1

- Create a list named `students` containing some student names (strings).
- Print out the second student's name.
- Print out the last student's name.

<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise 2

- Create a tuple named `foods` containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the `students` list.
- Use a `for` loop to print out the string "_food goes here_ is a good food".

<br>
<br>
<br>




#### Exercise 3

- Using a `for` loop, print just the last two food strings from `foods`.


<br>
<br>
<br>


#### Exercise 4

- Create a dictionary named `home_town` containing the keys of `city`, `state` and `population`.
- Print a string with this format:<br>"I was born in _city_, _state_ - population of _population_"


<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise 5

- Iterate over the _key: value_ pairs in `home_town` and print a string for each item, for example:

```shell  
	"city = Arcadia"
	"state = California"
	"population = 58000"
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise 6

- Create an empty list named `cohort`.
- Using a `for` loop, add one dictionary to the `cohort` list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:

```python
{
	'student': 'Tina',
	'fav_food': 'Cheeseburger'
}
```
- Iterate over `cohort` printing out each element.

<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise 7

- Using the list of `students` and list comprehension, assign to a variable named `awesome_students` a new list containing strings similar to this:<br>`["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]`
- Iterate over `awesome_students` printing out each string.

<br>
<br>
<br>



#### Exercise 8

- Using the tuple `foods` and list comprehension within a `for` loop, print each food string that contains the letter `a`.
