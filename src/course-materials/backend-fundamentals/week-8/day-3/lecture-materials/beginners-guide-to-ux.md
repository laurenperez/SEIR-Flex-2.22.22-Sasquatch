# Beginners Guide to UX

<br>
<br>
<br>

### What is UX/UI?

- User Experience (UX) is the process of enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the customer and the product.
- User Interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.

### Same product, different UX

## The Basics

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Goal Focused

A design should be centered around the user accomplishing their tasks. This requires stripping away any secondary or unnecessary features, and highlighting the features that will help.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Invisible

Controls and functions should be intuitive and self-explanatory, and not draw attention to themselves. Remove all distractions and potential hurdles so that the person has a clear path to their goal.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Forgiving

User errors are bound to happen, so design in a way that these errors won‚Äôt derail the user‚Äôs progress. This typically involves clear and friendly communication, like warnings before critical actions or potential errors.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Consistent

Consistency cultivates security and trust, whereas inconsistency is distracting and forces the user to question aspects unnecessarily. Have a single function work the same througout the entire site, i.e., if you click the red button on one page, it will perform the same action if you click it on another page. Consistency reduces the cognitive load which lowers the learning curve.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Smooth Onboarding

The onboarding phase, when a user learns how to use the product, greatly affects the opinion they form about it. Use this phase to point out features they may not notice or understand on their own. If there's any doubt about how something works, explain it - However, don‚Äôt take too long so they can get to using the product as soon as possible.

**A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it's not that good.**

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Bad Design vs. Good Design:

### Information Overload

Imagine you are a driver along this road on a Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. Can you park at this spot?

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

What sounds like a simple question takes a lot of mental processing to answer.

<br>
<br>
<br>

![parking sign](https://i.imgur.com/pNa0V6O.png)

<br>
<br>
<br>

You simply want to know whether they can park at a spot, yes or no, and that‚Äôs all the parking sign shows.

This design also makes use of visuals, rather than text, to convey information. The result is incredibly intuitive: green for OK, red for No Parking. It‚Äôs even designed for the color blind, with stripes for No Parking.

Now when you look at the sign, you‚Äôll know that on Tuesday at 9 a.m., parking is not allowed.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Mystery Meat Navigation

Mystery Meat Navigation refers to cases where the destination of a link is not visible until the user clicks on it or points the cursor at it. The term ‚Äúmystery meat‚Äù is a reference school cafeteria meals that are so processed that their exact type is no longer discernible.

Below is a screen shot of a real estate website, which is just a grid of thumbnails.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

Are they clickable? If you move your mouse cursor over an image, it changes to a pointer, but what happens when you click on an image?

‚ÄúClick and find out!‚Äù is never a good UX solution.

<br>
<br>
<br>

![where to click](https://i.imgur.com/Bs2kWTi.png)

<br>
<br>
<br>

These cards not only have ‚ÄúView Course‚Äù at the bottom of each to indicate the action that will happen, but also have a hover state with the text ‚ÄúGo to course‚Äù.

Always label your links! You wouldn‚Äôt like to eat mystery meat‚Äîand similarly, your users wouldn‚Äôt like to click on mystery links.

### How is Google's Home Screen:

- Goal Focused
- Invisible
- Forgiving
- Consistent
- Smooth Onboarding

<br>
<br>

### Even the secondary functionality of the site is intuitive.

### But I'm not a designer!

1. Share your projects with your friends, family, and fellow classmates! The best way to find fault in a project is for someone else to try and use it. Try to give them as little outside instruction as possible.
2. User stories! Write user stories from the perspective of the user: "As a user I want to be able to click on x and have y happen" or ‚ÄúAs a \_**\_, I need a \_\_** in order to \_\_\_\_‚Äù.

### Exercise

We're going to create the game tic-tac-toe ... but before we begin, what are some user stories that we'll want to make sure we cover?

üêò Reminder - Write from the perspective of the user: "As a user I want to be able to click on x and have y happen" or ‚ÄúAs a \_**\_, I need a \_\_** in order to \_\_\_\_‚Äù.

Share your user stories in the tech-talk channel as you write them!
