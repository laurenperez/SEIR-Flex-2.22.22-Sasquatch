## Lab Requirements

1. <a download href="/downloads/backend_fundamentals/producing-an-api-lab/mongoose-movies.zip">Download</a> the starter code.

2. Install the Node modules: `$ npm install`.

3. Create a RESTful API for the `movies` resource that includes all 5 RESTful routes.

4. The `cast` property of each _movie_ document must be populated with the _performer_ documents.

5. Collaborate and smile.
