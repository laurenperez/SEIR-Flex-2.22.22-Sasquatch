# Full Stack MERN on Mobile

## Review "Component Thought"

Components are the fundamental building blocks of UIs created using SPA's such as React, Angular, Vue, etc.

Remember when developing a React application, we construct the UI with a hierarchy of these components.

**Remember this wireframe:**

**And how your application could be broken into components like this:**

This is especially important when designing mobile apps, which can be less complex visually, but require careful thought when setting up component structures. 

Here are some things to note when designing for mobile:

- Because there is much less space on a mobile screen, every pixel is precious real estate. Make each button, div, or icon count! Less is more in mobile design. Too many things on the screen can look cluttered and overwhelming.
- Consider how users hold their devices when placing your interactive components. Can they reach the most important buttons with one hand?
- Can you see it? Text on a mobile screen should generally be larger than desktop. 
- Some CSS pseudo-classes do not apply in mobile land... Hover, for example, [is not a thing](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/mobile-doesnt-have-hover-dude-b37e8e0b586e) on mobile.


Most companies will even have a specific style guide for mobile: [Apple Developer Guide: Design Tips](https://developer.apple.com/design/tips/ )

### Design for the "Thumb Zone"

It's important to consider the positions of the hand(s) when holding a phone and using the thumb as the primary finger for navigating an app.

### Make your buttons descriptive

Well-designed buttons tell the user exactly what will happen when they click.

### Keep your UI simple and let it breathe 

A simple UI can be a treat to look at and more intuitive to use. Better to add extra screens (pages) than to try and fit more on one screen.  
Allow extra space (padding and margin) around your elements. Your eyes will thank you. 

Here is some simple mobile design inspiration:
