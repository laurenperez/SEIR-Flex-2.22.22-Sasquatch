Let's build a react giphy app!

Here is a [working version of the Giphy App](https://h6kdy.csb.app/)

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Your task is:

- Go to the Giphy docs [HERE](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/), _read_ them, create an account and get your Free API key.

- Diagram your App:
  - What components will you have?
  - Where would state "live"?
  - Where do you need to pass props?

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### 🚀 Completion looks like:

- Minimum of 3 components.
- A diagram of your component hierarchy.
- No gifs will be fetched on intial page load
- An application that renders a button on page load.
- On Button click make an API call and retrieve/render a single random GIF

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Done? You are awesome! Here is your 🍪
