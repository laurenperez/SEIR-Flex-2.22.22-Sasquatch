# React Static Components

<br>
<br>
<br>

## About this Build

Welcome to React. You've been showing off your portfolio and projects to your friends, family and classmates and they all say "It's fine. I like it!" But you want more insight.

So you decide to look into some analytical tools...but wow! They are expensive! You decide to make your own.

You visualize a dashboard with compontents for reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis and website visitors.

Try to recreate this wireframe with React. Be sure to create a few components (e.g. app, sidebar, reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis, website visitors).

## Get Started

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Set up

- `npx create-react-app dashboard`
- cd into new folder
- run `npm start` to run dev server

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Important Note

- To see updates you must refresh your browser, all three of the servers above do cache things, so you may have to do a hard refresh (hold shift key when doing a refresh) to see your changes.

Remember `command shift r` as the hot keys.

### Dark Theme!

Keep going! Add more details, add some css.
