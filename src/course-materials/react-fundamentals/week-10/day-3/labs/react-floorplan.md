# Floor Plan Bonus Lab

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Intro

In the _Intro to JSX_ lesson, you saw the following React basics:

- How to defining components as functions
- How to return a function component's UI defined using JSX
- How to pass props to components
- How to access the properties on props within a component

<br>
<br>

## Set Up

Create a React [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) named "Floor Plan".

<br>
<br>

## Minimum Requirements

1. Define each component in its own file. The naming convention to use for a component's file is UpperCamelCase, for example, a `<CodeSandbox>` component's file would be named `CodeSandbox.js` (`CodeSandbox.jsx` also works).

2. Export each component from its module. For example:

```jsx
// CodeSandbox.js

import React from "react"

function CodeSandbox(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>CodeSandbox</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

// Must export the component's function (or class)
export default CodeSandbox
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

3. Define the following components as functions and code them such that they fulfill their responsibilities:

   | Component      | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `<FloorPlan>`  | Rendered by `<App>`.<br>Renders the following components:<br>- A `<Kitchen>` component<br>- A `<LivingRoom>` component<br>- Three `<Bedroom>` components<br>- Two `<Bath>` components<br>**Render the components in any order you wish to make the floor plan more interesting.** |
   | `<Kitchen>`    | Renders the text "Kitchen" and the following components:<br>- A `<Oven>` component<br>- A `<Sink>` component                                                                                                                                                                      |
   | `<LivingRoom>` | Renders the text "Living Room"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | `<Bedroom>`    | Accepts a `bedNum` prop and renders the text "Bedroom [bedNum]" (substituting the value of the `bedNum` prop)                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | `<Bath>`       | Accepts a `size` prop and renders the text "[size] Bath", i.e., "Half Bath", "Full Bath"                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | `<Oven>`       | Renders the text "Oven"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | `<Sink>`       | Renders the text "Sink"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Add the following CSS inside of **styles.css** to style each component's wrapping `<div>` to make it easier to visualize the components:

```css
div {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

With the minimum requirements complete, the output should resemble:

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Hints

- If a component accepts a prop, that prop must be passed to it by the component that renders it, in other words, parent components pass props to their children components.

<br>
<br>

## Bonus

Style the components to make the output look like a floor plan:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AHq1tCF.png">

<br>
<br>

#### Hints

- Use `className` and/or `id` on React Elements (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, etc.) to apply CSS styling using CSS rules in the **styles.css** module.

- Styling the `<FloorPlan>` component as a CSS Grid is a great way to layout its children (grid items).

- Use props being passed in to generate a unique `id` on an element that can be used to target that element for custom styling. For example:

  ```jsx
  <div className='bedroom' id={`bed-${props.bedNum}`}>
  ```

  Would result in this `<Bedroom>` having a wrapping `<div>` like:

  ```jsx
  <div class="bedroom" id="bed-2">
  ```

  if it was rendered as:

  ```jsx
  <Bedroom bedNum={2} />
  ```
