## Overview

For your capstone project, you must choose a new technology and implement it on your own in a web application. This is a self-driven learning experience designed to prepare you for learning new technologies after graduation. This is what the real world of being an engineer is all about!

The complexity of this project is up to you, but there are some guidelines and a few requirements for scope. 
<br>

### Project Requirements
<br>

#### Your application must:

  - Utilize **at least one** new technology that was not taught during SEI Flex. 
  - Have at least **one model with full crud capability OR something equally complex**. (You will need approval from a squad leader if your proposed application does not include full crud)
  - Be fully deployed

#### Repo requirements:

- Readme will all the bells and whistles ( wireframe, screenshot, technology list, model details, future additions,  etc...)
- Frequent commits and clean, dry, code

#### Presentations Requirements:
  - 5 - 7 min presentation starting with readme, ending in a full site demo
  - Be prepared to give and receive written feedback from your peers

<br>

##### Here is [a guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-AM-RESOURCES/CAPSTONE_IDEAS) for suggested levels of complexity and some good advice on how you might get started. 
Please read through this guide fully before you start brainstorming.
