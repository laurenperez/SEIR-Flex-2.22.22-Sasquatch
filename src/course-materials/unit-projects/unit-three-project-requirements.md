# Project Three: A MERN Stack Application:

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date.

**Before you start working** on the planning for your project, be sure to review your idea with an instructional team to ensure that it both:

- **Meets the minimum requirements**, and
- **Is reasonably scoped**

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Necessary Deliverables

#### 1) Project Planning

A project consists of more than just code.

This project requires **planning** organized within a **Trello board** with the following **lists**:

- **Icebox**: Holds user stories that have yet to be moved to the _Current/MVP_ list. All user stories are originally put into the _Icebox_, including both MVP and wish list stories. 

- **Current/MVP**: Holds user stories that must be completed to meet the minimum project requirements (MVP). Once the MVP has been met, additional user stories may be moved from the _Icebox_.

- **Completed**: Hold completed user stories. 

- **Wireframes**: Sketches of each screens's user interface for the major functionality of the application.

- **Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)**: A diagram of the app's models (one per data entity) and the relationships between them.

> User stories need to be formed properly using this template:<br>`As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>`. The _reason_ is optional if it's patently obvious.

<br>
<br>
<br>


#### 2) Project Source Control & README

The project's source code must be hosted on a personal **GitHub repository**.

The repo is to contain **frequent commits** dated from the beginning of the project through its completion.

The project must include a **`README.md`** file with the following sections:

- **Introduction**: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.

- **Technologies Used**: A list of all technologies, libraries, APIs, etc. used in the project.

- **Getting Started**: Links to the project's planning (Trello board)  and the **deployed app** on Netlify.

- **Unsolved Problems**: List any unsolved issues.

- **Future Enhancements**: Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.

<br>
<br>
<br>


#### 3) Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables

- A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku & Netlify.

- Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**:
	- MongoDB/Mongoose
	- Express
	- React
	- Node

- **Have a well-styled interactive front-end** that communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX.

- **Include at least two of the four CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update & Delete) data operations/actions (having all four are optional)**

- **(OPTIONAL)** you can try to implement one or more of the following:
	- Consume a third-party API.
	- Include _admin_ features.
	- Client side routing to show multiple page-level components with React Router
	- Authentication, i.e. the ability of a user to log in & log out.
	- Authorization, by restricting functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

<br>
<br>


#### 4) Project Presentation

You will have 5-7 minutes to present and demonstrate the following:

1. Introduce your project by paraphrasing its README.

2. Click the link in the README to open the deployed app on Netlify.

3. Demonstrate the application's authentication features (if authentication added).

4. Demonstrate your app's main features.

5. Share/discuss the following code (not line-by-line):

	- Your "favorite" React component

6. Share the experience by answering the following:

	- What was your biggest challenge?
	- What are your key learnings/takeaways?

## Project Assistance

- At this stage of SEIR, being able to find the the answers to your development issues is of paramount importance. 

- Feel free to use all resources available and collaborate with others.

- If you do seek assistance in Slack, explain the issue, include screenshots, and explain what you've done to solve the issue on your own.

<br>
<br>
<br>




## Suggestions to Get Started

- Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features – simple is better. Favor fewer features that look/feel impressive over numerous clunky/sloppy features.

- Prioritize user stories and code them accordingly.

- When implementing a feature, think through the steps that it takes in plain language first. If necessary, write and/or diagram the steps to help guide your coding.

- Follow the steps we've done in class to implement features, beginning with the user's interaction, identifying the proper route, etc. 

- Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use.

## Best Practices

-  **Write DRY code.**

- In a SPA, communication with the backend is via AJAX.  Build **RESTful APIs to CRUD your data entities (resources)** and perform other functionality via AJAX.  In a React app, the best practice for AJAX related logic should be organized in "service" modules, not component modules.

- **Be consistent** with your code style.

- **Clearly name variables and functions** - remember, variables are usually named as **nouns** and functions as **verbs**.

- **Write well-formatted HTML/CSS/JS.** Properly formatting your code makes it more readable. Improperly formatted code infers sloppiness.

- **Comment your code where it makes sense**. Most code is self-documenting, however, comments help explain complicated code.

- If you have any questions regarding these requirements, please feel free to contact your instructional team!
