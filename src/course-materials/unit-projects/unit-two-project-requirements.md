# Project Two: Your First Full Stack Application

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack
application.** You'll be **building a Node/Express/MongoDB app** from the ground up yourself.

**You will be working individually for this project**, which means you'll be designing and coding the app yourself.

You get to decide what you want to build - as long as it meets the **Technical Requirements** outlined below.

Once you've decided what you will build, please contact your instructional team for approval of your idea and then begin working on the **Planning Requirements**.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Technical Requirements

### Your App Must:

☐ **Have at least 1 data entity (_A Model_)**. This entity must represent the main functional idea for your app.

☐ Have **complete CRUD data operations** on one of your data entities.

☐ Use a CSS stylesheet **(Additional Use of a CSS Framework such as Bootstrap or Materialize is optional, however your must have your own stylesheet with some styles defined as well)**

☐ Be **deployed online** (Heroku) - _We will show you how to do this_.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Optionally, Your App May:

☐ **Use authentication**.

☐ **Implement basic authorization** by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user, or the user that created that resource.

☐ Consume a third-party API.

☐ Expose its own API where it returns data resources as JSON. (You will need to research how to do this ... hint `res.json()`)

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Necessary Deliverables

☐ **A working full-stack app that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on Heroku**.

- **A Project `README.md` file** with these sections:

  ☐ **\<Your app's title\>**: A description of your app. Background info of the app is a nice touch.

  ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual app.

  ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

  ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed app and any instructions you deem important.

  ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

  > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ **Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project**. Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style landing page" instead of "Styled landing page".

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Planning Requirements

- You need to have turned in the following **before starting Project Week**:

- A **[Trello](https://trello.com/) board** with:
  - **User Stories**, each moving from left to right in the following
    three lists in your board:
  - **Ice Box**
  - **Current/MVP**
  - **Completed**

**User Stories must follow the following template:** _As a user, I want [feature], because [reason]._

The _reason_ is optional if it's blatantly obvious.

<br>
<br>

> **Note:** Prioritize your user stories within the Ice Box with your "wish list" stories at the bottom.

- **Wireframes of the main pages of functionality**, e.g. Landing Page, Posts Index Page, Favorite Posts Page, Add Post Page, etc.

- An **ERD** showing the attributes of each model (or schema in the case of embedding) and the associations between them.

<br>
<br>

### Presentation Requirements

You will have a maximum of 5 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:

1. **Introduce the Project:**

   ☐ Intro your app by paraphrasing the README.

2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

   ☐ Launch the app by clicking the link in the README.

   ☐ (**If auth added**) - sign up a new user, then immediately log out.

   ☐ (**If auth added**) - log in with your preferred user and demonstrate the features of the app.

   ☐ Be sure to demo full-CRUD data operations.

3. **Show/discuss your code:**

   ☐ Show the "main" Mongoose model.

   ☐ Show your favorite EJS template.

   ☐ Show the controller for the main model.

4. **Share the experience:**

   ☐ What was your biggest challenge?

   ☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?

5. **Q & A + Feedback**

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Discuss your app idea with an instructor to get their feedback before you dive too deep into user stories and wireframes.**
- **Remember to keep things small and focus on the MVP** – feature creep can doom a project!

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Project Idea Guidance

Nearly all of the applications you interact with on a daily basis
would do for this project as most are "full-stack" CRUD apps.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Do Not Do Non-CRUD Applications Such As:

- Games
- Portfolio, or presentational pages
- Marketing or content oriented websites

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Good Examples

Some of the best apps are solutions that track or manage things of **personal interest to you**:

- Music lesson tracking
- Soccer team tracker
- Rock climbing planner

So much of the Internet is CRUD apps!

- Social media:
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  - Reddit
- Marketplaces:
  - Craigslist
  - Etsy
- Organizational or Business apps:
  - Customer management
  - Payroll/Accounting

Many simple apps can have their functionality enhanced by implementing the ability of users to comment on, and/or like/favorite items.

Another piece of advice: If you choose to develop an app that has the concept of a shopping cart (storefront), do not attempt to implement the actual payment functionality.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If your instructors determine that your project does not meet the above requirements (denoted using checkboxes), you and your instructional team will coordinate a resubmission deadline.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide feedback, please ask!
