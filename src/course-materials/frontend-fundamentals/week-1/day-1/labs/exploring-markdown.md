## Intro

For this activity you will practice researching and learning _markdown_

_Markdown_ is a simple markup language that uses plain text characters for formatting.  For example, text between asterisk (`*`) characters is italicized and the `#` character is used to format lines as headings

Typically, _markdown_ is converted by applications into HTML and often allows the embedding of pure HTML within a markdown document

You will use _markdown_ to write README files which are used to document your projects

<br>
<br>



## Tasks

1. Research how to use the _Markdown_ language

2. Install a _Markdown_ editor/viewer

3. Create a cheatsheet for Bash Commands using Markdown -- _your first piece of technical documentation in this program_


<br>
<br>



### Research

Here are a few links that will help you learn _Markdown_:

- [GitHub Guide - Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

- [Another Amazing Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

- [Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/)

<br>



### Install a _Markdown_ Editor

For editing and viewing _Markdown_, use VS Code or a dedicated markdown editor such as [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).

### Create a Cheatsheet for Bash Commands

Although you can find numerous cheatsheets for Bash (Terminal) commands, why not create your own using markdown to get some practice with it?

Note that a cheatsheet need not be an exhaustive reference - so feel free to exclude commands that are used infrequently.

### Publish to your personal Github (optional)

For additional practice, you can publish your markdown git commands cheatsheet to your personal github. 

Here are the steps you'll need to take to make this happen:

1. Place your markdown file inside a folder. 
2. Initialize a local repository inside of it. 
3. Create a remote repository for it on Github.com.
4. Add the remote URL to your local repository.
5. Stage, Commit & push to Github.
6. Profit!
