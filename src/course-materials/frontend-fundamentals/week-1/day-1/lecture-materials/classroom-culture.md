# Communication

- Let us know how you're doing and how we can improve your experience

## Communication Tools

<br>

### Slack

#### 6 channels

- **`seirflex-222-classroom`**
- **`seirflex-222-outcomes`**
- **`seirflex-222-resources`**
- **`seirflex-222-partytime`**
- **`seirflex-222-homework`**

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### How To:

<br>

##### Communicate in one of the outrun channels:

**`@username`**

- sends a notification to a specific user

**`@channel / @here`**

- sends a notification to everyone / everyone currently online
- DO NOT use these unless absolutely necessary (usually only instructors/TAs use this)

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Communicate privately:

- Direct messages are one-on-one messages nobody else can see
- In addition, you can make group direct messages to talk to multiple people at once, privately

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Other:

- You can mute channels that you no longer need (e.g. Fundamentals)
- You can adjust the sound / notifications of your messages

<br>
<br>
