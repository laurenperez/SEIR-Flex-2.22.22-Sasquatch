# How to Successfully Learn in this Bootcamp

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Learning Objectives

- General advice and how to prepare yourself emotionally
- Some qualities of the most successful students
- Classroom culture
- Overview of common student concerns

<br>
<br>

## Emotional Framing

- Things will not go as you plan
- Deal with chaos in your head; being confused/lost is NORMAL
- No one pays you because you know all the answers
- The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution
- Make a friend with discomfort
- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic
- This experience is a rollercoaster

<br>
<br>

## Successful students

- The most successful students find programming fascinating; they don't think
  of it as an obligation or chore

- The most successful students go above and beyond what we teach; if there is
  something they feel they should know, they will go and learn it

- If there is a problem for which they think they need more information to solve, they go and find that information

- The most successful students don't wait for instructors to hand them the answer

- Successful students quickly see that programming is not about learning a recipe,
  it's about developing a mindset to solve unforeseen problems

- Hard Work: the equivalent of another full-time job (~40 hrs per week)

- Be open and ready to receive constructive criticism

<br>
<br>

## Classroom Culture

- Open safe environment
- Take ownership of your experience
- Check your ego at the door
- Empathy
- Be courteous calm and patient with others; don't let the stress get to you!
- Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday

<br>
<br>

### Mentorship / Collaborative Culture in the Classroom

- Take care of each other
- Benchmarking: some are good at one thing, others at another; leverage each other's strengths
- Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept
- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!

<br>
<br>

## Common Student Concerns

**I'm making a lot of mistakes**

- Mistakes are a part of life as a developer

<br>

**I don't feel comfortable with the material**

- You probably will never feel the material is easy, but you should be able to do the work
- By the end of each unit project, you should feel mostly comfortable with applying the material

<br>

**I feel good during class, but it's difficult to innovate on my own**

_There are three stages to learning something:_

- Imitation (follow along)
- Assimilation (repetitive simple tasks: homework and labs)
- Innovation (build something new on your own - project time)

<br>

**Everyone at work will realize I know nothing**

- This is called the imposter syndrome, and it's very common
- Nobody knows everything, it's about how well you learn

<br>

**I don't "do" math**

- That's why we have the computer do it for us!
- Programming is more about thinking logically than doing equations

<br>

**What's the best practice? What's the one "correct" answer?**

- Best practices change constantly and from company to company
- If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice
- All that matters is "Does it work?"
  - A company that hires someone with 3 months of experience doesn't care too much about code quality
  - Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving

<br>

**I don't have a perfect understanding of everything**

- Class is set up to accommodate students of all abilities
- We make sure you understand at least the most important concepts
- Only the people who write the specifications for the language understand everything about the language

<br>

**I want an amazing portfolio and to complete all my labs/assignments**

- You won't be happy with how your first projects look/function; what matters is the ability to think
- Don't worry about completing every lab/homework
  - They're there as an exercise in thinking with enough material for all
  - Completing and sleeping for 2 hours is worse than sleeping and not completing

<br>
<br>
<br>

**In summary, we ask you to trust the process and know that if you practice what you learn long enough, the skills will come.**
