# Loops and Conditionals Lab

Now, let's get in a little bit of JavaScript practice; specifically, more loops!

<br>
<br>

## Setup

For this lab, create an `HTML, CSS & JS` [repl.it](https://repl.it) and name it **`Loops and Conditionals Lab`**

Inside the `script.js` file inside your repl, please write the following:

<hr>

1. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 0-99 (ascending)

2. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 99-0 (descending)

3. Create a loop that logs the **EVEN** numbers from 0-98 (ascending)

4. Create a loop that logs the **EVEN** numbers from 98-0 (descending)

5. Create a loop that logs the **ODD** numbers from 0-99 (ascending)

6. Create a loop that logs the **ODD** numbers from 99-0 (descending)

7. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 49-72 (ascending)

8. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 81-26 (descending)

9. Create a loop that logs the numbers from 3-90 **that are multiples of 3** (ascending)
