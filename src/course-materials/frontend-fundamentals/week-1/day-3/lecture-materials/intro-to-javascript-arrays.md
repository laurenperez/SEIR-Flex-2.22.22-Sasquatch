### Lesson Setup

For this lesson, we're going to code along using a `JavaScript` `REPL` from [repl.it](https://repl.it) -- you can name it `"JavaScript Arrays Practice"`.

### The Use Case (What & Why) of Arrays

- <strong>What are Arrays?</strong> - Technically, arrays in JS are objects - Arrays are "list-like" objects with keys of "0", "1", etc - They contain zero or more items called - **elements** (not to be confused with HTML elements) - Each element in an array can hold any data type including objects, functions, even other arrays - Unlike objects, their items are considered to be **ordered** - It is a best practice to name array variables plurally, e.g., `let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];`

* <strong>Why use Arrays?</strong> - Arrays are the data structure of choice for holding lists of data - Without complex data types such as arrays or objects, we'd have to store every individual piece of data in separate variables resulting is lots of messy code

<br>
<br>

### Creating Arrays

- There are two ways to create an array...

```javascript
// using a Class/Constructor Function (less common syntax)
let nums = new Array(2, 4, 18);

// using Array Literal syntax (recommended best practice)
let nums = [2, 4, 18];
```

- The best practice is to use the _Array Literal_ syntax because it's more concise and the Class approach behaves differently if you pass only one argument

<br>
<br>

### Creating Arrays - Exercise (2 mins)

- Create an array consisting of three of your favorite movies (strings) and assign it to a variable named `movies`

<br>
<br>

### Accessing Elements in an Array

- We access elements in an array using **square bracket notation**, passing in the "index" (position) of the element you want to access:

```javascript
let movies = ['Caddyshack', 'Interstellar', 'Scarface'];
let firstMovie = movies[0];  // 'Caddyshack'
```

> Since when is `0` the first item in anything? Since computer science came along!<br> Internally, programs prefer to think in terms of "offsets" in memory. Thus, we access the first item using an offset of zero - arrays are "zero-based" in JS.

- We can add elements to the **end** of an array using the `push` method:

```javascript
movies.push('Trading Places', 'Antitrust');
```
Note that more than one element can be added at a time.

- We can also add to the **front** of an array with `unshift`:

```javascript
movies.unshift('Star Wars');
```

<br>
<br>

### Removing Elements from an Array

- We can remove a single element from the **end** of an array using the `pop` method:

```javascript
let movie = movies.pop();
```

- We can also remove from the **front** of an array with `shift`:

```javascript
movie = movies.shift();
```

- `pop` and `shift` only remove one element at a time and don't take any arguments

<br>
<br>


### Remembering `unshift` & `shift`

- `push` & `pop` are easy to remember, but `unshift` & `shift` are not so clear

- Maybe this will help you remember:

```shell
The "longer" named methods do the same thing (add to an array)
unshift -> [...] <- push

The "shorter" named ones remove
shift <- [...] -> pop
```

<br>
<br>


### Add/Remove Elements to/from Anywhere in the Array

- The [Array.prototype.splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) method is capable of adding and/or removing any number of elements to/from an array with a single line of code!

- `splice` has a syntax of: `array.splice(start, deleteCount, newItem1, newItem2...)`

Examples of adding/removing elements with `splice`:

```javascript
movies => ["Caddyshack", "Interstellar", "Scarface", "Trading Places"]
let removedMovies = movies.splice(3, 1, "Spaceballs", "Alien")
movies => ["Caddyshack", "Interstellar", "Scarface", "Spaceballs", "Alien"]
removedMovies = movies.splice(0, 3)
movies => ["Spaceballs", "Alien"]
removedMovies = movies.splice(1, 0, "The Sting")
removedMovies => []
movies => ["Spaceballs", "The Sting", "Alien"]
```

The `splice` method always returns an array containing the removed elements.

<br>
<br>

### Iterate Over All of the Elements in an Array

- Although a `for` loop can be used to iterate over an array, if you know you want to iterate over **all** of the elements in an array, the `forEach` method is a better approach:

```javascript
movies.forEach(function(movie) {
	console.log(movie);
});
```

* Try it out. As you can see, the `forEach` method calls the function provided as an argument **once for each element** in the array
* You can also access the index of each iteration:

```javascript
movies.forEach(function(movie, idx) {
	console.log(idx + ' ' + movie);
});
```

* Note that it's a good practice to name the parameter that accepts each element as the singular of the array, or simply the first letter of the array variable (`movie` or `m` for the example above)

- ES2015 provides the `for...of` loop for iterating over the elements of arrays and other iterables such as strings:

```javascript
for (let movie of movies) {
	if (movie === 'The Last Airbender') break;
	console.log(movie);
}
```

- Unlike `forEach`, the `for...of` loop can be exited using the `break` statement

<br>
<br>


### Copy All or Some of an Array

- There are multiple ways to copy an array

- The approach you use depends upon whether you need to copy just some or the entire array

- Let's take a look...

- We can use the [Array.prototype.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method to create a copy of all, **or part**, of an array

- The `slice` method always returns a new array and does not mutate (change) the source array

- Example:

```javascript
movies => [ 'Spaceballs', 'The Sting', 'Alien' ]
let lastTwoMovies = movies.slice(1, 3); // ['The Sting, 'Alien']
```

- Unlike `splice`, the 2nd argument in `slice` represents the ending index (but does not include that index)

<br>
<br>


### Copy All of an Array

- ES2015 gave us a cool new way to copy an entire array using the `...` ([spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax))

- Example:

```javascript
movies => [ 'Spaceballs', 'The Sting', 'Alien' ]
let moviesCopy = [...movies];
```
The elements are being "spread" within the array literal

<br>
<br>

### Copy All of an Array & Insert

- Here's how you can copy and insert additional elements simultaneously using the spread operator:

```javascript
movies => [ 'Spaceballs', 'The Sting', 'Alien' ]
let moreMovies = ['Interstellar', ...movies, 'Contact'];
```

<br>
<br>

### Create a Single String from an Array

- An array method that comes in handy is `join` which creates a string from all of the elements in an array:

```javascript
let movieStr = movies.join();
=> 'Spaceballs,The Sting,Alien'
```

- As you can see, by default, the movies were delimited by a comma. However, we can pass `join` whatever string we want to use as the delimiter:

```javascript
movieStr = movies.join('    ');
=> 'Spaceballs    The Sting    Alien'
```

<br>
<br>


### Essential Questions

**❓ In your own words, what's an array?**

**❓ What will be the value of the variable `color`:**

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
let color = colors[1]
```

<br>
<br>

**❓ What's the best method to use to iterate through an entire array?**

**❓ What method is used to copy a number of elements into a new array?**

<br>
<br>

### Further Study

- Because arrays are such a useful data structure, it's beneficial to developers to know what methods are available and what they do

- Array iterator methods are extremely useful and we will cover them in a later lesson

- Other useful methods worth knowing about: - `indexOf` / `lastIndexOf` - `includes` - `reverse` - `sort`
