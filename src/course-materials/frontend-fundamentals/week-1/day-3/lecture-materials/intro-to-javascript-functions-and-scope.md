### Lesson Setup

For this lesson, we're going to code along using a `JavaScript` `REPL` from [repl.it](https://repl.it) -- you can name it `"JavaScript Functions and Scope Practice"`.

<br>
<br>

### 1. What is a function?

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a single purpose.

It optionally takes in data as input and returns a single piece of data (including complex data such as objects, functions, etc.).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZWcx9wI.png">

Functions are the building blocks of programs!

The code in a function does not execute until that function is executed.

Sometimes functions execute in response to events happening, such as when:

- When a user clicks something
- A timer "ticks", etc

In addition to the functions we write, programming languages typically include numerous built-in functions.

Functions commonly call other functions.

<br>
<br>

### 2. Why Functions Anyway?

<br>

#### Tackle Complexity

There's no better way to tackle a complex problem than by breaking it into smaller problems.

Functions allow us to break up programs into more manageable blocks of code.

<br>

#### Code Reuse

Functions provide code reuse because they can be called over and over.

Without functions, we might have to write the same code in multiple places of the app which violates a key principle known as **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself!

**❓ What would be the downside of violating the DRY principle by repeating the same code in multiple places throughout a program?**

<br>
<br>

#### Documentation & Debugging

Simply naming functions appropriately, e.g., `renderBoard`, documents what the program is doing.

Organizing code into functions also makes it easier to find and fix code that's not working as expected, a process known as **debugging**.

<br>
<br>

#### Summary

In summary, it would be impractical to create applications without breaking up the application into functions.

Here's a simple example of how an app that sends out a daily business report might be broken up into functions:

```javascript
let date = new Date();
let sales = getSalesData(date);
let labor = getLaborCosts(date);
let budget = getBudget(date);
let report = generateReport(date, sales, labor, budget);
sendReport(report);

function getSalesData(forDate) {
  let netSales = getNetSales(forDate);
  let salesTax = computeSalesTax(netSales);
  return {netSales, salesTax};
}

function getLaborCosts(forDate) {
  let staffCosts = getStaffCosts(forDate);
  let mgtCosts = getMgtCosts(forDate);
  return {staffCosts, mgtCosts};
}

function getBudget(forDate) {
  let salesBudget = getSalesBudget(forDate);
  let laborBudget = getLaborBudget(forDate);
  return {salesBudget, laborBudget};
}

function generateReport(forDate, dailySales, dailyLabor, budget) {
  ...
}

function sendReport(report) {
  ...
}

// etc.

```

<br>
<br>

#### Review

**❓ Which would be a better programming practice:**

- **Code numerous, smaller functions**<br>-or-<br>
- **Code fewer, larger functions**

<br>
<br>

### 3. Defining and Calling Functions

<br>
<br>

#### Defining Functions

There are three primary ways to define functions in JS:

<br>

##### 1) Function Declaration (AKA Function Definitions)

```javascript
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name + "!")
}
```

<br>

##### 2) Function Expression

```javascript
const sayHello = function(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name + "!")
}
```

**What similarities and differences do you see between the two approaches?**

<br>
<br>

##### Primary Difference Between Function Declarations & Expressions

For all practical purposes, the difference between them is that _function expressions_ cannot be invoked before they are defined; whereas _function declarations_ are **hoisted** to the top of their scope and can therefore be invoked even if they are defined later in the source code. <br><br>For example:

```javascript
fnDeclaration() // thank you function declarations :)
fnExpression() // TypeError: fnExpression is not a function

function fnDeclaration() {
  console.log("I'm coming from a function declaration")
}

const fnExpression = function() {
  console.log("I'm coming from a function expression")
}
```

> Note: Attempting to execute a function expression before it's been assigned to its variable is the source of many an error for JS developers!

<br>
<br>

##### 3) Arrow Functions

ES2015 delivered a third approach to defining functions - **Arrow Functions**.

The following function declaration:

```javascript
// Function Declaration
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

and the following arrow function are equivalent:

```javascript
// Arrow Function
const add = (a, b) => a + b
```

Arrow Functions offer:

- A more concise syntax
- Implicit return of a single expression
- A single rule for binding the `this` keyword

However, as cool as Arrow Functions are, they cannot be used in every scenario due to the way they bind `this`.

Rest assured we'll be using Arrow Functions during this course, however, for this lesson we'll focus on Function Declarations and Expressions which have served the language well for over 20 years...

<br>
<br>

#### Calling Functions

Regardless of which of the three approaches are used to define functions, we call them the same way:

```javascript
add(25, 100) // returns 125
```

> **Developer Vocab:** Developers might say **call**, **execute**, **invoke** or "**run** a function" - they all mean the thing.

<br>
<br>

##### Let's Write Another Function

Let's write the following function together in our `script.js` file:

```javascript
function areBothEven(n1, n2) {
  return !(n1 % 2) && !(n2 % 2)
}
```

The `areBothEven` function is defined to accept two arguments. <br><br>These arguments should be numbers, otherwise the function as written won't work as expected.

The `return` keyword returns the result of the expression that follows it - which looks kind of crazy, but isn't as intimidating as it appears when you break it down.

> Note: In the real world, much of the code you write will be code designed prevent and handle error conditions. For example, in the `areBothEven` function above, it would be important to ensure that both of the inputs are numbers. However, in SEIR, we will minimize the amount of error handling code so that we can focus more on what it is we're trying to teach. There just isn't enough time, so we must prioritize.

Let's invoke the function a couple of times to try it out.

**❓ Is the above function a function _declaration_ or _expression_?**

Now it's your turn...

<br>
<br>

#### Practice Writing Functions

You're going to write two functions, one as a function declaration & the other as a function expression.

This will be an individual exercise, however, feel free to seek guidance from a partner via direct message or posting a question in the classroom Slack channel if you get stuck.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### EXERCISE 1: Write a Function Declaration

Write a function named `computeArea` using the function declaration approach.

It will have two parameters: `width` & `height`.

It will compute the area of a rectangle (_width_ X _height_) and return a string in the following form:

> **The area of a rectangle with a width of **_ and a height of _** is \_\_\_ square units.**

Invoke the function to test it.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### EXERCISE 2: Write a Function Expression

Write a function named `planetHasWater` using the function expression syntax.

It will have one parameter: `planet`.

Return `true` if the `planet` argument is either "Earth" or "Mars", otherwise return `false`.

Bonus points if you ensure the function will work regardless of the casing of the `planet` being passed in ('earth', 'MARS', etc.).

Invoke the function a couple of times to test it!

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### FUNCTION REVIEW QUESTIONS

**❓ How many different ways are there to define a function?**

**❓ What's the only practical difference between a function definition and a function expression?**

<br>
<br>
<br>

### 4. Parameters/Arguments

There are a few tidbits about parameters/arguments to ponder:

- First, let me answer a common question: _"What's the difference between a parameter and an argument?"_

      	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/u5p9n7m.jpg">

- Parameters become local variables inside the function body.

- Therefore, in the example above, `bottle` and `cap` are variables that can be accessed anywhere within the function.

- Just like when naming variables and functions, it's important to name parameters using identifiers that convey the data they will hold.

- Arguments are assigned to their respective parameter positionally. In the example above, the `bottle` parameter would be assigned the string "green bottle" because they are the first parameter and argument respectively.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Fewer Arguments

JavaScript is very flexible and won't complain when the number of arguments is not the same as the number of parameters defined.

If fewer arguments are passed than parameters defined, then the parameter variables without a matching argument would be set to `undefined`.

> Note: Unlike some other programming languages, JavaScript won't complain if fewer (or extra) arguments are passed to a function. However, the function that depends on certain arguments to do its job might raise an error or return an unexpected result if it doesn't receive the proper arguments.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Extra Arguments

Let's pretend you need to write a function that accepts an unknown number of arguments.

For example, let's say we would like to be able to call a function that accepts a developer's name and any number of their job skills, something like the following:

```javascript
let maria = getDevObject("Maria", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "jQuery")
```

and want that function to return a JS object shaped like this:

```javascript
{
	devName: 'Maria',
	jobSkills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'jQuery']
}
```

A non-arrow function can access all of its arguments using a "hidden" variable inside of the function named `arguments`.

`arguments` is an array-like JS object that has a `length` property and allows its values to be accessed via _square bracket_ notation.

This is how we could use the `arguments` object to code the function:

```javascript
function getDevObject(name) {
  let skills = []
  for (let i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    skills.push(arguments[i])
  }
  return {
    devName: name,
    jobSkills: skills,
  }
}
```

> Note: We'll be covering objects later today, so don't worry if the above doesn't look familiar.

Although the above function works, ES2015 delivered a better approach to working with extra arguments called **Rest Parameters**.

Using _rest parameters_, the above function can be written as follows:

```javascript
function getDevObject(name, ...skills) {
  return {
    devName: name,
    jobSkills: skills,
  }
}
```

The `...skills` that's defined will be a true array (unlike `arguments`) holding any extra arguments provided to the function.

Obviously, there can only be a single rest parameter and it must be the last parameter in the list.

When writing new code, devs should use **rest parameters** instead of `arguments` because:

- The existence of the rest parameter in the parameter list better documents the function
- The rest parameter is a true array and thus includes all of the nifty methods that arrays have

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### ES2015 Default Parameters

What if your function requires certain arguments and you want to provide a default value for the parameter if an argument is not supplied when the function is invoked?

Prior to ES2015, here is trivial example of what we had to do:

```javascript
function setColor(bicycle, color) {
  // set color to 'purple' if not provided
  bicycle.color = color || "purple"
}

const bike = new Bicycle()
setColor(bike, "blue") // sets color to blue
setColor(bike) // sets color to purple by default
```

Now, using **default parameters**, we can do this:

```javascript
function setColor(bicycle, color = "purple") {
  bicycle.color = color
}
```

Any expression can be provided as a default, including objects, etc.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Functions as Arguments

In JavaScript, it's easy to pass around functions like data - because they are - they're objects!

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Passing an Anonymous Function

Often functions or methods (functions attached to an object) will require a function be provided as an argument.<br><br>For example, the `forEach` method on arrays:

```javascript
var a = ["red", "green", "blue"]

a.forEach(function(color) {
  console.log(color)
})
```

Since the function provided to the `forEach` will never be called anywhere else in the code, why create a separate named function and pass it in? <br><br>**Anonymous functions** like shown above can really come in handy!

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### PARAMETER/ARGUMENT REVIEW QUESTIONS

**❓ What's the difference between an _argument_ and a _parameter_?**

**❓ Explain how _arguments_ and _parameters_ are "matched up".**

<br>
<br>

### 5. Scope

<br>

#### What is Scope?

In general, the concept of **scope** in computer programming pertains to the **accessibility** of variables and functions from a given point of the code. In other words, as you write a line of code, what variables and functions do you have access to?

JavaScript has three types of scope:

- A single **global scope**
- **function scope**, also known as **local scope**
- and, **block scope** which was added by ES2015's `let` & `const`

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Why the Different Types of Scope?

There's a concept in programming known as **The Principle of Least Access**.

The principle is based on the idea that limiting the accessibility of variables (and functions) helps reduce bugs in the code - think of it as a form of "code security".

A practical benefit of having different scope, however, is being able to use the same names for variables in different functions! If there were only one scope, this wouldn't be possible.

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Examples of Scope

Ignoring _block scope_ for the moment, let's review the following diagram demonstrates both _global_ and _function_ scope:

![](https://i.imgur.com/UtIoe7F.png)

The diagram identifies 3 different scopes along with the identifiers (variables and functions) that live within each scope.

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### You can look out, but you can't look in!

A key takeaway is that functions have access to the set of variables and functions defined within their own scope AND in the **outer** scopes.

Basically, when a line of code accesses a variable (or function), JS will traverse up the **scope chain** until it finds what it's looking for.

If the JS runtime engine gets to the _global scope_ (which is the top of the food chain in the scope hierarchy) and still can't find what it's looking for, that's when your program ceases due to a **ReferenceError**.

**❓ Does the function `foo` have access to the variable `c`?**

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Global Scope

In our browsers, the global scope is represented by the `window` object.

It is at the top of the scope chain and its properties are available to **every** function we write.

It is generally bad form for our programs to create variables in the global scope. Doing so risks us overwriting data in use by JS libraries/frameworks or other routines.

Creating lots of global variables is referred to as "polluting the global scope", and we all know that it's not nice to pollute!

If we define a variable (or a function) within the global scope, it becomes a property on the `window` object. You can see this in action by typing `var pollution = 'sucks'` in the console, then type `window.` (don't forget the dot), scroll down and find the pollution we have created - yuck!

> Although using both `var` and `let` in the global scope results in a global variable being created, interestingly, those created using `let` and `const` do not appear as properties on the `window` object.

**Any questions before moving on the lab where you'll practice writing several functions?**

<br>
<br>
<br>

### 6. Further Study

<br>

##### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

One way we can prevent our code from leaking into the global scope is by wrapping it with a construct known as an **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**, or "IIFE" (pronounced "iffy"). It looks like this:

```javascript
;(function() {
  "use strict"

  // your code here...

})()
```

**❓ Why does this construct virtually prevent variables and functions from being created in the global scope?**

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Block Scope

Both `let` and `const` define variables that can only be accessed within the **code block** they are defined in.

A _code block_ is created by using curly braces.

The following code from [MDN's docs about let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) demonstrates differences between `let` and `var`:

```javascript
function varTest() {
  var x = 1
  if (true) {
    var x = 2 // same variable!
    console.log(x) // 2
  }
  console.log(x) // 2
}

function letTest() {
  let x = 1
  if (true) {
    let x = 2 // different variable
    console.log(x) // 2
  }
  console.log(x) // 1
}
```

and another example of their differences:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/K0uJx2P.jpg">

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### Hoisting

Remember how we can call function declarations before they are defined thanks to _hoisting_?

As shown above, similarly, a variable's **declaration** (but not its assignment), is hoisted to the top of the function when it's declared using `var`.

For example, when we write code like this:

```javascript
function hoist() {
  console.log(x) // outputs undefined, not a ReferenceError
  var x = 25
  console.log(x) // outputs 25
}
```

Internally, the JS engine actually sees this:

```javascript
function hoist() {
  var x
  console.log(x) // outputs undefined, not a ReferenceError
  x = 25
  console.log(x) // outputs 25
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Nesting Functions

As the examples above have shown, we can define functions within functions!

Why would we want to do this? Well, Perhaps an outer function needs a "helper" function that would only be relevant only to a given function. It would be good programming practice to "hide" that function from the rest of the program by nesting it within the function that actually needs it.

For example (no need to execute this):

```javascript
function openNewAccount(name, openingBalance) {
  let acctNum = generateAcctNum()

  // createAccount is a function available outside this function
  let acct = createAccount(acctNum, openingBalance)
  return acct

  // helper function that provides a unique account number
  function generateAcctNum() {
    return Date.now() // super amazing algorithm :)
  }
}
```

As you can see, there's a nifty `generateAcctNum` function in there and it's only relevant to when a new account is opened, so it's nested within the `openNewAcount` function.

<br>
<br>
<br>
