# Intro to DOM Events

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Learning Objectives

**Students will be able to:**

- Add event listeners for events such as `click`
- Explore the event object
- Explain event bubbling
- Use event bubbling to implement event delegation

<br>
<br>

## Roadmap

- What are DOM events?
- Setup
- What's an **event listener**?
- Our first **event listener**
- The event object
- Creating a new element
- Event bubbling
- Event delegation

<br>
<br>

### Lesson Setup

- Create a folder called `intro-to-dom-events`
- Inside of `intro-to-dom-events` create the following folder/file structure:

```shell
intro-to-dom-events/
  index.html
  script.js
```

- You can add this HTML to your `.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Intro to DOM Events</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

<br>
<br>

### Setup

- Add a `<script>` tag to include `script.js` in the `<head>`:

  ```html
  <head>
    ...
    <title>Intro to DOM Events</title>
    <script defer src="./script.js"></script>
  </head>
  ```

- The `defer` attribute ensures the DOM is ready before the script executes.

- Putting a temporary `alert('js loaded')` will verify `script.js` is being loaded.

<br>
<br>

### What are DOM Events?

- DOM events are the bedrock of interactivity on web pages.

- DOM events enable us as developers to implement **event-driven programming**. This programming paradigm is such that much of our code runs in response to events being triggered during run-time.
- Lots of events are being generated within the browser, for example, when:

  - A user moves or clicks the mouse
  - A user presses a key
  - When a form is submitted
  - When the page has finished loading or has been resized
  - etc.

- Take a gander [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) at the type and sheer number of events.

<br>
<br>

### What's an Event Listener?

- An **event listener** is a function, more specifically, a _callback function_, that is called when an event fires.

- Event listeners may also be referred to as _event handlers_.

- There are three different approaches for registering event listeners:

  - In the HTML (inline): `<button id="reset-btn" onclick="reset()">`
  - Assigning to DOM elements' properties: `resetBtn.onclick = reset;`
  - Calling `addEventListener()` on a DOM element

  - Using the HTML approach (`onclick="reset()"`) is typically frowned upon because it requires that the function be in the global scope. In addition, this, like inline styling, kind of breaks the **separation of concerns** design principle.

- The DOM element approach (`resetBtn.onclick = reset;`) is better because the function does not have to be in global scope, however...

- The `addEventListener` approach is widely considered to be the best practice because it has the flexibility of adding multiple listener functions!

- Here is the common syntax for _registering_ an event listener for a given event: <br> **`element.addEventListener(<event-name>, <callback>, <use-capture>);`**

  - **event-name** is the name of the event (string)
  - **callback** is the function we want executed when the event happens. When called by the JS engine, it will be passed an _event object_ as an argument.
  - **use-capture** is a boolean and is optional. It has to do with _event phases_. We won't need to worry about it in SEI but if you want to know more, read the [Event Phases section of this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/an-introduction-to-dom-events/).

<br>
<br>

### Our first Event Listener

- Add the following HTML to the Project we setup:

  ```html
  <h3>Comments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>SEIR Rocks!</li>
  </ul>
  <input />
  <button>Add Comment</button>
  ```

- When we click the **Add Comment** button, we want to create a new comment with the text entered in the input and then clear the input.

- We can add a `click` event listener to pretty much any element - not just buttons. However, buttons are pre-styled to look and act clickable :)

- <p>We're going to use an anonymous callback function in this first example:</p>

  ```javascript
  const btn = document.querySelector("button")
  btn.addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
    // testing!
    console.log(evt)
  })
  ```

- If all goes well, clicking the button should log out the **event object**.

- Congrats, registering an event listener is that easy!

### Review Questions

**❓ What is the name of the method used to attach event listeners to elements?**

**❓ What is that method's _signature_ (a method's name, the number & type of arguments it takes, and what it returns)?**

**❓ Name three events that might be triggered in the browser.**

<br>
<br>
<br>

### The _event object_

- Examining the **event object** that was provided as an argument to our event listener reveals lots of useful information about the event!

- Of special interest are:
  - Several `...X` and `...Y` properties that provide where the click occurred.
  - The `target` property, which holds a reference to the DOM element that triggered (dispatched) the event.
  - Note that JS's `this` keyword within the listener function will be set to the DOM element that `addEventListener` was called on.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Creating a new `li` element

- If we want to add a new comment, we're going to need to create a new `<li>` element.

- Here's how we can do it using the `document.createElement` method:

  ```javascript
  btn.addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
    const li = document.createElement("li")
    console.log(li)
  })
  ```

  > Note: At this point, the element is "in memory" only and is not part of the DOM (yet).

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Creating a new Comment

- Okay, we have a new `<li>` element created and assigned to a variable named `li`, but it has no content.

- We want to get whatever text the user has typed into the `<input>` element.

- As an exercise, find the property that holds the content of an `<input>`.

- Hint: "Select" the `<input>`, `console.dir` it out and explore!

- When you find the property - reply to my message in slack!

- So, now we can set the `textContent` of the new `<li>`:

  ```javascript
  btn.addEventListener("click", function (evt) {
    const li = document.createElement("li")
    const inp = document.querySelector("input")
    li.textContent = inp.value
  })
  ```

- Now the new `<li>` is ready to be added to the DOM!

- **Which element do we we want to add the `<li>` to?**

- There are several ways to add DOM elements to the document using JavaScript.

- A common way to add new elements to another element is by using the `appendChild` method like this:

  ```javascript
    li.textContent = inp.value;
    // new code below
    document.querySelector('ul').appendChild(li);
  });
  ```

  Note that the new element is appended as the last child.

- Test it out - nice!

- The new comment has been added, but if we want to improve the UX, we have one more task - clear out the `<input>`.

- One line of code is all it takes - you got this!

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Event bubbling

- When an event occurs on an element, that event, whether it is listened to on that element or not, _bubbles_ up through the DOM, all the way up to the `document` object.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/B7f5PAZ.png" width="900">

- All event listeners registered for the same event, such as `click`, will be invoked along the path to the `document` element - unless one of those listeners calls the **event object**'s `stopPropagation` method.

- Why does JS bubble up (propagate) its events?...

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Event Delegation

- Imagine a web app, like a game perhaps, with lots of elements that need to respond to a click. It's possible there could be tens, hundreds or more of these elements.

- That would be a lot of listeners, wouldn't it - not very efficient at all.

- Plus, every time a new element is added, the event listener would also have to be registered!
- Event bubbling allows us to implement what's known as **event delegation**.

- Event delegation allows us to register a **single** event listener that can respond to events triggered by any of its **descendants**. Much more efficient!

- Let's register a listener (this time for kicks we'll use a named function) on the `<ul>` that can respond to clicks on any of its `<li>`s:

  ```javascript
  document.querySelector("ul").addEventListener("click", handleClick)

  function handleClick(evt) {
    console.log(evt)
  }
  ```

- Importantly, the event object's `target` property is set to the **actual** element that was clicked!

- Not only is event delegation more efficient, by it's very design, it's dynamic - as descendants are added, they too will be listened to!

- Without event delegation, you would have to register a listener every time a new element, such as our comment `<li>` is added.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Event Delegation (Practice)

- **Practice: Write the code to change the color of the text of a clicked comment.**

- Hint: DOM elements have a `style` property that's an object with the CSS properties (named using camel-casing), e.g., `myLi.style.fontSize`.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Removing event listeners

- It's possible to remove an added event listener, however, only if a named function was used as the callback:

  ```javascript
  btn.removeEventListener("click", handleClick)
  ```

  This would remove the 'click' event listener (`handleClick`) that was registered on the `btn` element like this:  
  `btn.addEventListener('click', handleClick);`

<br>  
<br>  
<br>

### Essential Questions

**❓ What is the argument that JS passes to an event listener when it calls it?**

**❓ What is the name of the property on the above argument that represents the DOM element that dispatched the event?**

**❓ Let's say you needed to have an event listener respond to a `click` event on the `<td>`s within a `<table>` - would you have to add event listeners to each `<td>`? Support your answer.**
