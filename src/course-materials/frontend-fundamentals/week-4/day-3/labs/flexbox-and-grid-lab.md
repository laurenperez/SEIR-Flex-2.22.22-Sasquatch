# CSS Flexbox / Grid - Lab

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Intro

Time for some practice laying out elements using Flexbox and CSS Grid!

This lab is **not a deliverable**.

<br>
<br>


## Lab

- Choose either the vertical or horizontal "profile card" above to reproduce using HTML and CSS.

- Use a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid to layout the individual elements as close as possible - however, it does not have to be perfect!

<br>
<br>


## Set Up

For this lab assignment, please use a HTML, CSS, JS on [repl.it](https://repl.it)

<br>
<br>


## Hints

- Be sure to start with a bit of CSS reset:

	```css
		* {
		  box-sizing: border-box;
		}
		
		body {
		  margin: 0;
		  font-family: Helvetica;
		}
	```

- Use the _Digital Color Meter_ application that comes with the Mac to "pick" the colors from the screen.

- Elements can be made to appear circular by using `border-radius: 50%;`.

## Bonus

As a bonus, reproduce both the vertical and horizontal versions!
