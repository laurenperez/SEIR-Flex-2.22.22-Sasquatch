# Build a Weather App With AJAX



<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>





**The Lab is a Deliverable**

- Create an app that uses a search form to show the weather in any city the user searches for.

- For example, you can model this project after what we did for the AJAX Movies exercise for the AJAX lesson.
  
- Set this up as a seperate project repo, and push it to your personal GitHub.

- Use the [Open Weather map](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get a forecast and display it on the page.

- Create a project folder with the usual setup ... i.e. `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files in their appropriate sub folders.

- If the user searches for another city, make sure the page is only showing ONE city's forecast at a time (i.e. make sure the previous results don't stay on the page).

## Bonus

- Allow a drop-down menu for the user to choose how many days' worth of forecasts they want, then display that many days of weather predictions on the page.
- Add basic components to your app such as a `header`, `nav`, `footer` ...etc.
- Add styling with `CSS`.

- Create a `README.md` inside of your project's root directory you can use to describe what your app does.

- Example headers in your project's README might include:
  - The Title of your App
  - Technologies/API used
  - Features
  - User Stories
  - Wireframes (you place hosted images in your README)
  - Stretch Goals/Future Goals
