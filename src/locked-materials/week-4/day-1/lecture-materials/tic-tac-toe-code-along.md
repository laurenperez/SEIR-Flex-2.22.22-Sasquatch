# Tic-Tac-Toe Code Along

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Objective

Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game incorporating the three web app technologies you've worked with thus far:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Minimum Requirements

- Display an empty tic-tac-toe board when the page is initially displayed.
- A player can click on the nine cells to make a move.
- Every click will alternate between marking an `X` and `O`.
- Once occupied with an `X` or `O`, the cell cannot be played again.
- Provide a `Reset Game` button that will clear the contents of the board.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Getting Started

- Create a new project folder named `tic-tac-toe`.

- **note** As a suggestions, create a repository for this project on your personal github.

- Create an `index.html` page inside the root of `tic-tac-toe`.

- Create your `style.css` and `script.js` files inside of their appropriate sub-folders ... i.e. `css/style.css` & `js/script.js`.

- Start by writing the HTML and CSS that displays a 3x3 grid and the `reset game` button.

- Using `id`, `class`, and/or `data` attributes will help you target elements for styling and wiring up your click event listeners.

- Programs, including games, are frequently focused on manipulating data and displaying that data to a user. Decide on the data structures, held in variables, that will maintain the _state_ (data / status) of the game.

- Note that the values you use to represent the state of your game, doesn't necessarily have to match what you want to display. For example, just because you want to display X and Os doesn't mean that you have to use those letters in your data structure. You might choose to use 1 to represent player X and -1 to represent player O for example. Then, in your _render_ function you would have the logic to translate data to what you want to display.

- Wire up your click event listener(s). Using a single listener with event bubbling is recommended but not required.

- Lots of little functions!

### Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a detailed description of what an application must do, written in natural language instead of a particular programming language.
Well-written pseudocode should be easily translated into actual code.
The best way to get started is to start with the "big picture" of what the app needs to do:

```shell
1) Define required constants
2) Define required variables used to track the state of the game
3) Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable and performant.
4) Upon loading the app should:
    4.1) Initialize the state variables
    4.2) Render those values to the page
    4.3) Wait for the user to click a square
5) Handle a player clicking a square
6) Handle a player clicking the replay button
```

Since most web apps are event-driven by nature. Coding an event-driven program generally requires that we set up the application when it loads (steps 1 - 4) and wait for the user to interact with the app (steps 5 & 6).
Now we can start filling some more detailed steps:

```shell
1) Define required constants:
    1.1) Define a colors object with keys of 'null' (when the square is empty), and players 1 & -1. The value assigned to each key represents the color to display for an empty square (null), player 1 and player -1.
    1.2) Define the 8 possible winning combinations, each containing three indexes of the board that make a winner if they hold the same player value.
2) Define required variables used to track the state of the game:
    2.1) Use a board array to represent the squares.    2.2) Use a turn variable to remember whose turn it is.
    2.3) Use a winner variable to represent three different possibilities - player that won, a tie, or game in play.
3) Store elements on the page that will be accessed in code more than once in variables to make code more concise, readable and performant:
    3.1) Store the 9 elements that represent the squares on the page.
4) Upon loading the app should:
    4.1) Initialize the state variables:
        4.1.1) Initialize the board array to 9 nulls to represent empty squares. The 9 elements will "map" to each square, where index 0 maps to the top-left square and index 8 maps to the bottom-right square.
        4.1.2) Initialize whose turn it is to 1 (player 'X'). Player 'O' will be represented by -1.
        4.1.3) Initialize winner to null to represent that there is no winner or tie yet. Winner will hold the player value (1 or -1) if there's a winner. Winner will hold a 'T' if there's a tie.
    4.2) Render those state variables to the page:
        4.2.1) Render the board:
            4.2.1.1) Loop over each of the 9 elements that represent the squares on the page, and for each iteration:
                4.2.1.1.2) Use the index of the iteration to access the mapped value from the board array.
                4.3.1.1.3) Set the background color of the current element by using the value as a key on the colors lookup object (constant).
        4.2.2) Render a message:
            4.2.2.1) If winner has a value other than null (game still in progress), render whose turn it is - use the color name for the player, converting it to upper case.
            4.2.2.2) If winner is equal to 'T' (tie), render a tie message.
            4.2.2.3) Otherwise, render a congratulatory message to which player has won - use the color name for the player, converting it to uppercase.
    4.3) Wait for the user to click a square
5) Handle a player clicking a square:
    5.1) Obtain the index of the square that was clicked by either:
        5.1.1) "Extracting" the index from an id assigned to the element in the HTML, or
        5.1.2) Looping through the cached square elements using a for loop and breaking out when the current square element equals the event object's target.
    5.2) If the board has a value at the index, immediately return because that square is already taken.
    5.3) If winner is not null, immediately return because the game is over.
    5.4) Update the board array at the index with the value of turn.
    5.5) Flip turns by multiplying turn by -1 (flips a 1 to -1, and vice-versa).
    5.6) Set the winner variable if there's a winner:
        5.6.1) Loop through the each of the winning combination arrays defined.
        5.6.2) Total up the three board positions using the three indexes in the current combo.
        5.6.3) Convert the total to an absolute value (convert any negative total to positive).
        5.6.4) If the total equals 3, we have a winner! Set winner to the board's value at the index specified by the first index in the combo array. Exit the loop.
    5.7) If there's no winner, check if there's a tie:
        5.7.1) Set winner to 'T' if there are no more nulls in the board array.
    5.8) All state has been updated, so render the state to the page (step 4.2).

6) Handle a player clicking the replay button:
    6.1) Do steps 4.1 (initialize the state variables) and 4.2 (render).
```

Using a numbered outline is not required but helps organize the more complex steps into detailed steps.
