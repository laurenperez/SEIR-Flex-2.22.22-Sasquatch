## Lab/Homework Submission Procedures

<br>
<br>

### We will walk through this together the first time!

- Depending on the assignment, your homework will be completed on [repl.it](https://repl.it/), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), or [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- **Fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/Hzzc53H3Ya8SsGvf6) with a link for that specific homework.** It will be the same Google Form for each homework
- **Homework is due one week from the day it was assigned**
- If homework is marked `incomplete`, you may be asked to re-submit it; a new timeline will be discussed how long you have to re-submit the homework
- **Homework Feedback is generally administered within one week from the due date**

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Managing your Projects

- At the end of each unit, you will create a repo in your personal github for your project i.e. -
  Unit One - Project One 
  Unit Two - Project Two  ...etc
- Pushing your labs/homework to your personal github is not recommended

<br>
<br>

<br>

## Additional Expectations

- Take initiative.

<br>
<br>

### Classroom Culture

Let's all agree to:

- Treat each other with respect
- Avoid bringing distractions into class
- Participate in class
- Be on video with mute on during class

<br>
<br>

### How To Succeed in a Remote Environment

- Communication is key! Please respond in a "reasonable" timely manner if we contact you via slack or email.
- No distractions during class. This means no cell phones (talking/texting), television, or children around.
- Make sure to speak up and speak out about any problems you are having! Don't be afraid to ask questions during class! Someone else is probably having this same issue!
- Carve out at least 10 hours outside a class a week for review and homework. Expect the next 6 months to be out of the norm for you. If you have to carve out a personal hour during a family vacation, you will have to do this!
- Make use of office hours! Find a time that works for you and don't cancel on your instructors :)
- Hold yourself accountable. Don't let yourself fall behind!
